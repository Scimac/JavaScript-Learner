- In JavaScript, functions come with two built-in methods: `call()` and `apply()`. 
- These methods allow you to call a function and **explicitly set the value of `this` within the function's execution context.** 
- They also enable you to pass arguments to the function. Both methods are used for similar purposes, but they have a slight difference in how they accept arguments.

#### call() Method

- The `call()` method is a function method that allows you to call a function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments passed in as separate arguments.
- It takes the `this` value as its first argument and the function arguments (if any) as subsequent arguments, separated by commas.
- This method is useful when you want to invoke a function in the context of a specific object or change the value of `this` inside the function.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
function.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

**Example - Calling a Function with a Specified this Value** 
```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  },
};

const anotherPerson = { name: "Jane" };

person.greet.call(anotherPerson); // Output: Hello, Jane!
```

**Example - Passing Arguments with `call()`**
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add.call(null, 3, 5);
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

#### apply() Method

- The `apply()` method is a function method similar to `call()`, but it accepts arguments as an array or an array-like object.
- Like `call()`, it allows you to set the `this` value of the function, but it takes the arguments as an array.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
function.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...]);
```

**Example - Using apply() to Change this Value**
```javascript
function saySomething(message) {
  console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}!`);
}

const person = { name: "John" };

saySomething.apply(person, ["Hello"]); // Output: Hello, John!
```

**Example Passing Arguments with `apply()`**
```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

const argsArray = [3, 5];
const result = multiply.apply(null, argsArray);
console.log(result); // Output: 15
```

#### Common Use Cases for `call()` and `apply()`

1. Inheritance and Method Borrowing: You can use `call()` or `apply()` to call a function from another object and execute it in the context of the current object, effectively inheriting methods from other objects.

2. Function Context Manipulation: When working with callback functions or event handlers, you might use `call()` or `apply()` to ensure that the callback executes in the desired context.

3. Arguments Forwarding: If you have a function that takes a variable number of arguments, you can use `apply()` to forward an array of arguments.

#### Note

> Since ES6, the spread operator (`...`) is a more convenient and modern way to pass arguments from an array to a function, which makes `apply()` less commonly used in modern JavaScript development. 

> Nevertheless, understanding `call()` and `apply()` remains valuable when working with legacy code or in specific scenarios where they might still be needed.
