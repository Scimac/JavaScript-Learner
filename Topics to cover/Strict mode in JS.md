Javascript is young rapid-evolving language. New features, functionalities are suggested and added virtually every day to JS, AND the main thing that is taken care that **old code is never gets broken**.

All the new features are generally off by default, cause this might induce a lot of errors and quirks in JS, in order to explicitly enable them, we need to add `"use strict"` at the top of the `.js` file.

> **make sure that `"use strict"` is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.**

> There’s no way to cancel `use strict`. There is no directive like `"no use strict"` that reverts the engine to old behavior. Once we enter strict mode, there’s no going back.
