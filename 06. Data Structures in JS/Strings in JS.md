Strings in JS are usually enclosed in single or double quotes or backticks.

Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in `${…}`. 

**This saved us from teh comples looking expression un string assignment
// Example**

**Hitting enter btn in bactick helps us create multiple lines**

A string may consist of zero characters (be empty), one character or many of them.
