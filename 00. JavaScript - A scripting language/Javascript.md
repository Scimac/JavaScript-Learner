## What is JS?

**JavaScript** is a **High Level, Object -based, scripting/programming language** that allows you to implement complex features mainly on web. 

Some of the uses of Javascript include:
 - Creating interactive web pages and applications
 - Create web servers and writing server-side software using Node.js
 - Creating web based games and art using the HTML `<canvas>` apis along with JS
 - Progressive Web Apps, Native apps using libraries/framewarks like React Native and Ionic framework, Desktop apps with Electron frameworks.

- Now a days every device have a program installed to understand Javascript, they are called [JavaScript Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine). 

-  [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine) "V8 (JavaScript engine)") from [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") is the most used JavaScript engine. [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome "Google Chrome") and the many other [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser) "Chromium (web browser)")-based browsers use it, as do [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software") built with [CEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework "Chromium Embedded Framework"), [Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework) "Electron (software framework)"), or any other [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework") that embeds Chromium. Other uses include the [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js "Node.js") and [Deno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deno_(software) "Deno (software)") [runtime systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system "Runtime system").
-   [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey "SpiderMonkey") is developed by [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla "Mozilla") for use in [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox "Firefox") and its [forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development) "Fork (software development)"). The [GNOME Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell "GNOME Shell") uses it for extension support.
-   [JavaScriptCore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore "JavaScriptCore") is [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.")'s engine for its [Safari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser) "Safari (web browser)") browser. Other [WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit "WebKit")-based browsers also use it. [KJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KJS_(software) "KJS (software)") from [KDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE "KDE") was the starting point for its development.
-   [Chakra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra_(JScript_engine) "Chakra (JScript engine)") is the engine of the [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer "Internet Explorer") browser. It was also forked by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") for the original [Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge "Microsoft Edge") browser, but Edge was later rebuilt as a Chromium-based browser and thus now uses V8.
