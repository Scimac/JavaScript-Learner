Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met. They are essential for performing repetitive tasks efficiently.

### Basic Loops

#### For Loop

The for loop allows you to loop through a block of code a specific number of times. 
```javascript
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // code to be executed
}
	// The initialization statement initializes a variable to be used in the loop.
	// The condition statement defines the condition for the loop to continue running.
	// The iteration statement is executed each time the loop has run.
```

Example:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

#### While Loop

The while loop allows you to loop through a block of code while a specific condition is true. while loops is mostly used when the condition is know but the number of iteration isn't known.

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

Example:
```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

#### Do-While Loop

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.

```javascript
do {
  // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

Example:
```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### Advanced Loops

#### For...of Loop

The for...of loop is used to loop **through the values of an iterable object** (such as an array or string).

```javascript
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

Example:
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (const item of arr) {
  console.log(item);
}
// Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

#### For...in Loop

The for...in loop is used to loop **through the properties of an object**. 

```javascript
for (variable in object) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

Example:
```javascript
const person = { name: "John", age: 30, gender: "male" };
for (const property in person) {
  console.log(`${property}: ${person[property]}`);
}
// Output: name: John, age: 30, gender: male
```

> Do not use **for in** over an Array if the index **order** is important.

> for...in loops over all properties in the object, including the prototype's properties.
> while for...of loops only over the current properties of an object

Here, The index order is implementation-dependent, and array values may not be accessed in the order you expect. It is better to use a **for** loop, a **for of** loop, or **[[HIgher order Functions in Array|Array.forEach()]]** when the order is important.
### Break, Continue

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement early. 

For example, in a `for` loop, the `break` statement can be used to exit the loop prematurely if a certain condition is met.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // exit the loop when i is 5
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

The `continue` statement is used to skip over the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next one. 

For example, in a `for` loop, the `continue` statement can be used to skip over certain values of the loop variable.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue; // skip even numbers
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

### Labels for Loops

The `label` statement is used to provide a name for a block of code, which can then be referenced by the `break` and `continue` statements. 

For example, a label can be used to break out of a nested loop:
```js

outerloop:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  innerloop:
  for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    if (i === 2 && j === 2) {
      break outerloop; // break out of both loops
    }
    console.log(i, j);
  }
}
```

> The `label` statement is not commonly used, and its use can make code more difficult to read and understand. However, there are certain situations where labels can be useful, such as with nested loops.
