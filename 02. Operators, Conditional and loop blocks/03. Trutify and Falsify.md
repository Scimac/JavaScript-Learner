- In JavaScript, every value can be interpreted as a truthy or falsy value.

### Truthy Values

Truthy values are any values that are considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. Here are some examples of truthy values:
	-   `"hello"` (a non-empty string)
	-   `42` (a non-zero number)
	-   `true` (the Boolean value `true`)
	-   `[]` (an empty array)
	-   `{}` (an empty object)
	-   `function() {}` (an empty function)

### Falsy Values

Falsy values are any values that are considered false when encountered in a Boolean context. There are only 5 falsy values in JavaScript:
	-   `""` (an empty string)
	-   `0` (the number zero)
	-   `null` (the absence of any value)
	-   `undefined` (a variable that has not been assigned a value)
	-   `NaN` (Not a Number)

Example:
```js
let obj = {};
if (obj && obj.prop && obj.prop.length) {
  console.log('obj.prop has a truthy value and is not empty');
} else {
  console.log('obj.prop is falsy or empty');
}
// Output: obj.prop is falsy or empty
```

### Logical And, Or - Truthy/Falsy values detectors

- Both logical And (&&), Or (||) read the expression from left to right and **they don't evaluate the whole expression!!**

- **Logical And always finds the first Falsy value**
	
    -  Logical And `&&` obtains it's behaviour from Bitwise And `&`, i.e if any one value is false, whole result is false no matter what the other values are.
    - Therefore, it stops for checking for other expressions if any one of the expression is **false**.

- **Similarly, Logical Or always finds the first Truthy value**
	
    -  Logical Or `||` obtains it's behaviour from Bitwise Or `|`, i.e if any one value is true, whole result is true no matter what the other values are.
    - Therefore, it stops for checking for other expressions if any one of the expression is **true**.

	**But why exactly is this relevant ??**

This helps in - 

1. Short circuit Evaluation (mostly used in conditional statements for removing bugs)
	
	Short curcuiting the statements providing thus helping reducing bugs, like in conditional statements.
	```
	if (x !== undefined && x !== null && x !== "") {
	  // do something with x
	}
	```
	
	```js
	let arr = null // arr has no values
	
	if (arr && arr.length) { // removing first term will cause run-time error!!
		arr.forEach((obj) => sum += obj.value)
	}
	console.log(arr)
	```

2. Conditional Variable Assignment
	```js
	let userName = nickName || firstName || lastName || 'user';
	//saved us a lot of if and elses
	```

> Precedence of AND `&&` is higher than OR `||`.
>  `a && b || c && d` is essentially the same as `(a && b) || (c && d)`, if the `&&` expressions were in parentheses.

### Did You Know?

-   The double exclamation mark (`!!`) can be used to convert any value to its boolean equivalent. For example, `!!"hello"` would evaluate to `true`.
-   The logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators return the last evaluated operand, not necessarily a boolean value. For example, `"hello" && 42` would evaluate to `42`.
