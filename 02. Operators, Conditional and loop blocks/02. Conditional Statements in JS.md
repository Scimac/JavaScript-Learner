Conditional statements are used to execute specific code blocks based on certain conditions.

### if/else Statements

- `if` statements are used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. The basic syntax for an `if` statement is:

```js
if (condition) {  
	// condition` is evaluated to determine whether it is true or false
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

- You can also add an `else` statement to execute a different block of code if the condition is false:

```js
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```

- You can also use `else if` statements to chain multiple conditions together:

```js
if (condition1) {
    // code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to execute if all conditions are false
}
```

Example.

```js
let num = 10;
if (num > 5) {
    console.log("The number is greater than 5");
} else {
    console.log("The number is lesser than 5");
}

// ##################### //

let num = 5;
if (num < 0) {
    console.log("The number is negative");
} else if (num > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive");
} else {
    console.log("The number is zero");
}
```
 
- `if (condition)` statement evaluates the expression passed as `condition` in its parentheses and converts the result into [[03. Trutify and Falsify|truthy and falsy]] values, i.e
	- Values such as `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` all are called “falsy” values.
	-  All other values become `true`, so they are called “truthy” values.

So, the code under this condition would never execute:
```js
// if the complex condition computes to falsy value
if (0) { /*/* 0 is falsy*/ }

// if the complex condition computes to truthy value
if (1) { /* 1 is truthy */ }
```

Eg.
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };

if (arr.length > 5 || obj.gender === "male") {
  console.log("Truthy");
} else {
  console.log("Falsy");
}

const userName = '';
if (userName) {
	handleAuth(userName);
}

const arr = ['err', 0, 2, 3, 15];

if (sum(arr) > 0) {         // sum(arr) will return '0err02315'
	console.log('Addition of nums completed')
}
```

### Ternary Operator

- The ternary operator is a short-hand way of writing an if-else statement.
```js
(condition) ? true-expression : false-expression;
```

- The ternary operator can be nested within itself, making it useful for complex conditional logic. **However, it's important to use it judiciously, as excessive nesting can make code harder to read and maintain.**

Example:
```js
let age = 25;
let message = (age < 18) ? "You are too young" : "You are old enough";
console.log(message); // Output: "You are old enough"

let ageMessage = (age < 18) ? "You are too young" : 
                (age < 25) ? "You are still young" : 
                "You are old enough";
console.log(ageMessage); // Output: "You are still young"
```

In this example, if the first condition is false, it checks the second condition, and if that's also false, it returns the third expression.

### switch Statements

`switch` statements are used to execute a block of code based on different cases. The basic syntax for a `switch` statement is:

```js
switch (expression) {
	// `expression` is the value that is being compared to each case
	
    case value1:
        // code to execute if expression is equal to value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to execute if expression is equal to value2
        break;
    default:
        // code to execute if none of the cases are true
        break;
}
```

- Swith statement matching criteria - 
	- Switch cases use **strict** comparison (`===`).
	- If multiple cases matches a case value, the **first** case is selected.
	- If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the **default** label.
	- If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) **after the switch**.

>  `break` keyword is used to exit the switch statement after a case has been executed. If no case is true, the code inside the `default` block will be executed.

>  If `break` keyword is not added, all the cases after the successful case starts executing even if the evaluation does not match the case.

 Example:
```js
let day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("Today is Monday");
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        console.log("Today is Tuesday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Today is neither Monday nor Tuesday");
        break;
}
```
