Methods are functions that are associated with objects. They are defined as properties of an object and are called using the object name followed by the dot notation.

### Definition and Usage:

Methods in JavaScript are functions that are bound to objects. They can perform operations, manipulate data, or interact with the object's properties.

```javascript
const calculator = {
  add: function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
  subtract: function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }
};

calculator.add(5, 3); // 8
```
### Key Points:

1. **Object Association:**
   - Methods are closely associated with objects and are defined within the context of an object.

2. **Dot Notation:**
   - Methods are called using the object name followed by the dot notation and the method name.

   ```javascript
   objectName.methodName(arguments);
   ```

3. **Accessing Object Properties:**
   - Methods have access to the object's properties and can manipulate or retrieve data as needed.

4. **Example:**
   - In the example above, the `add` and `subtract` functions are methods of the `calculator` object.

   ```javascript
   calculator.add(5, 3); // Output: 8
   ```

### Benefits:

- **Object Encapsulation:**
  - Methods allow for the encapsulation of functionality within the context of an object, promoting clean and organized code.

- **Code Reusability:**
  - Methods can be reused across multiple instances of an object, reducing redundancy and enhancing code maintainability.

- **Object Interactivity:**
  - Methods facilitate interaction with object properties, enabling dynamic and context-specific behavior.

Methods are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming in JavaScript, providing a way to organize and encapsulate functionality within the context of objects. They play a crucial role in creating reusable and maintainable code structures.
