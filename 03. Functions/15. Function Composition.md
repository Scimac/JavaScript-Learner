Function composition is a powerful technique in functional programming where multiple functions are combined to create a new function. This allows for the creation of more complex and specialized functions by chaining together simpler, modular functions.

### Definition and Syntax:

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.
#### Syntax

```javascript
const compose = (f, g) => (x) => f(g(x));
```
#### Key Points:

1. **Combining Functions:**
   - Function composition combines two or more functions to create a new function.

2. **Order of Execution:**
   - In function composition, the rightmost function is applied first, and its result becomes the input for the leftmost function.

3. **Chaining Functions:**
   - Functions are chained together, creating a sequence where the output of one function serves as the input for the next.
#### Example

```javascript
// Function composition example
const compose = (f, g) => (x) => f(g(x));

const addTwo = (x) => x + 2;
const multiplyByThree = (x) => x * 3;

// Compose the functions
const composedFunction = compose(addTwo, multiplyByThree);

// Use the composed function
const result = composedFunction(5); // Output: (5 * 3) + 2 = 17
```

### Benefits and Use Cases:

- **Modularity:**
  - Function composition promotes modularity by breaking down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.

- **Readability:**
  - Composition enhances code readability by expressing complex operations as a series of simple, well-named functions.

- **Reusability:**
  - Composed functions can be reused in various contexts, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

### Real-World Use Case:

Consider a scenario where you have two utility functions, one to format a string and another to capitalize it. You can compose these functions to create a new function that formats and capitalizes a string:

```javascript
const formatString = (str) => str.trim();
const capitalizeString = (str) => str.toUpperCase();

// Compose the functions
const formatAndCapitalize = compose(capitalizeString, formatString);

// Use the composed function
const result = formatAndCapitalize("   hello   "); // Output: "HELLO"
```

### Best Practices:

- **Pure Functions:**
  - Use pure functions when composing, as they have no side effects and produce the same output for the same input.

- **Compose Small Functions:**
  - Break down complex operations into small, focused functions to make composition more flexible and readable.

- **Reusability:**
  - Aim for functions that are reusable on their own and gain additional functionality when composed.

Function composition is a valuable technique for building maintainable and modular code. By composing small, focused functions, you can create powerful and versatile functions that adapt to various scenarios.
