### Definition and Syntax
```javascript
// Anonymous function syntax 
const functionName = function(parameters) {   
  // function body 
};  

// Example 
const greet = function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); 
};
```
### Usage and Benefits

**Anonymous functions**, as the name suggests, lack a defined name but bring versatility and functionality to your codebase.

1. **Callback Functions:**
   - Often employed as callback functions to handle events or asynchronous operations.

2. **Function Expressions:**
   - Can be assigned to variables or used as expressions, enhancing code modularity.

3. **Encapsulation:**
   - Aids in encapsulating code, keeping it separate from the global scope for better organization.

4. **Flexibility:**
   - Immediately invoked or passed as arguments to other functions, offering dynamic execution.

#### Examples:
```javascript
// IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
(function() {
  console.log("I am an anonymous function being immediately invoked.");
})();

// Using an anonymous function as a callback
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This is executed after a delay.");
}, 2000);

// Using an anonymous function as an event handler
document.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log("You clicked the document.");
});
```
### Key Points

- **No Defined Name:**
  - Anonymous functions lack a specific name and are declared using function expressions.

- **Callback Power:**
  - Commonly used as callback functions or for encapsulating code.

- **Immediate Invocation:**
  - Can be immediately invoked or passed as arguments, providing flexibility.

- **Code Organization:**
  - Enhances code organization and modularity, contributing to a cleaner codebase.

- **Dynamic Coding:**
  - Powerful tools for handling dynamic and temporary code requirements.

Anonymous functions are versatile and robust elements in JavaScript, offering a range of solutions for dynamic and temporary coding needs. Their immediate invocation and flexible usage make them valuable contributors to JavaScript programming.
