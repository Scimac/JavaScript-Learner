Functions are one of the core building blocks of JavaScript. In this document, we will explore the differences between function declarations and function expressions in JavaScript.

### Function Declarations

A function declaration is a **named function** that is defined using the `function` keyword. 

```js
function Function_Name (parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) { 
	// Function_Body 
}

function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

One key characteristic of function declarations is that they are "[[Hoisting in JS|hoisted]]" to the top of their scope. This means that you can call a function before it is defined, and JavaScript will still recognize it:

```js
greet("Alice"); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"

function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

### Function Expressions

A function expression is similar to a function declaration, but it is defined using an expression rather than a statement. 

```js
// In this example, `greet` is a variable that holds an anonymous function. 
const greet = function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```

Unlike function declarations, **function expressions are not hoisted**. This means that you must define a function expression before you can call it:

```js
greet("Alice"); // Output: Uncaught TypeError: greet is not a function

const greet = function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```

### Function declarations vs Function expressions

The key difference between function declarations and function expressions is that function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, while function expressions are not.

Another important difference is that function expressions can be named or anonymous, while function declarations must have a name.

Here's an example that illustrates these differences:

```js
greet("Alice"); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"

// This is a function expression, and it is anonymous
const greet = function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

// This is a function declaration, and it is named
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

### DYK (Did You Know)

- Function declarations must have a name, while function expressions can be named or anonymous.
- You must define a function expression before you can call it.
- Function expressions are often used to define callback functions, while function declarations are often used to define reusable utility functions.
- Function Expression can be named too. 
	```javascript
	// Named function expression
	const greet = function sayHello(name) {
	  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
	    if (name === "John") sayHello("Johnny!!")
	};
	
	// Usage
	greet("John"); // Output: Hello, John!
	// sayHello("Mack"); ---> Throws a function undefined error
	
	// Accessing the function name
	console.log(greet.name); // Output: sayHello
	```
	Named function expressions provide the advantage of having a meaningful name that can be used for self-reference or debugging purposes, compared to anonymous functions.
