Callback functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows you to pass a function as an argument to another function. The receiving function can then invoke the callback function at a certain point in its execution.

### Definition and Usage

A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and is invoked or called within that function. Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous operations, event handling, and higher-order functions.
#### Syntax

```javascript
// Function with a callback parameter
function mainFunction(arg1, arg2, callback) {
  // Main function logic

  // Invoke the callback function
  callback();
}

// Example usage with a callback function
mainFunction(value1, value2, function() {
  // Callback function logic
});
```
#### Example

```javascript
// Example 1: Callback function as an argument
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("John", sayGoodbye);

// Output:
// Hello, John!
// Goodbye!

// Example 2: Asynchronous callback
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = "Sample Data";
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}

function processData(data) {
  console.log(`Processing data: ${data}`);
}

fetchData(processData);

// Output (after 2 seconds):
// Processing data: Sample Data
```
### Benefits and Use Cases

1. **Asynchronous Operations:**
   - Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous operations like AJAX requests, timers, and event handling, where the function is invoked once the operation completes.

2. **Higher-Order Functions:**
   - Callback functions enable the implementation of higher-order functions, which accept other functions as arguments, allowing for flexible and reusable code.

3. **Modularity and Reusability:**
   - Callback functions promote modularity and reusability by separating concerns and allowing for customized behavior in different contexts.
   
### Key Points

- Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions and invoked within them.
- They are commonly used in asynchronous operations and higher-order functions.
- Callback functions promote modularity, reusability, and customization of behavior.
- Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the context in which they are used.

Understanding callback functions allows you to handle events, perform asynchronous operations, and create reusable functions.
