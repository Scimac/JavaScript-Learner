## Inheritance

- JS uses a prototype inheritance model. Inheritance in JavaScript is based around the prototype object.
- Acquiring the attributes and methods from the prototype or the base object is known as Inheritance.
- when JS wants to find a property of a method, it looks on the current object first, if not found it looks into it's immediate ancestor all the way up to the prototype, until the property or method is found.
- different ways of inheritance in JS with examples -using classes and super, prototype, object.create and init method.
