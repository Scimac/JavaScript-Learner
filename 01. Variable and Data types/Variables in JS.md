Topics needed to be covered - 

1.  [[01. Intro to Variables]]: What are variables, why are they used, and how to declare variables in JavaScript.
2. [[03. DataTypes in JS#1. Primitive Data Types| Primitive data types]]: Explanation and examples of the six primitive data types in JavaScript, including string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.
3.  Type coercion: Explanation of how JavaScript automatically converts data types in certain situations, such as when performing operations on variables of different types.
4.  Objects: Explanation of objects in JavaScript, including how to create and modify objects, and how to access properties and methods of objects.
5.  Arrays: Explanation of arrays in JavaScript, including how to create and manipulate arrays, and how to access array elements.
6.  Scope: Explanation of variable scope in JavaScript, including global and local scope, and how to use block scope with let and const.
7.  Hoisting: Explanation of variable hoisting in JavaScript, including how JavaScript automatically moves variable declarations to the top of their scope.
8.  [[02. Difference between var, let and const#const|Constants]]: Explanation of how to use constants in JavaScript with the const keyword.
9.  Type checking and conversion: Explanation of how to check data types using the typeof operator, and how to convert between data types using built-in functions like parseInt and parseFloat.
