In JS, we can declare variable with any one of the three - `var`, `let` and `const`.

But each one have their own different quirks. Just a note, `var` was itroduced in 1995 and was singlehandedly used to declare variables up until, 2015, when `let` and `const` were introduced.

> If you expect the script to run in very old browsers, use `var`, else use `const` to declare all the variable or use `let` to declare ones that you think might change their values.

**Here only the differences between all the three are listed, try to implement examples on your own for more mental clarity!!**

### var

1. `var` declarations are **globally scoped or function/locally scoped**. The scope is global when a `var` variable is declared outside a function and is available for use in the whole file/window..
2. `var` variables can be re-declared and updated.
3. So `var` variables are [[Hoisting in JS|hoisted]] to the top of their scope and **initialized with a value of** `undefined`.
	```js
	
	function myFunction () {
		// hoisted to the top as ---->>  var checkVar;
		
		console.log(checkVar);     // undefined
		
		var checkVar = "My value is initialized here!";
		console.log(checkVar);     // "My value is initialized here!"
		
		var checkVar = 1254;       // Redeclaration throws no error!!
		console.log(checkVar);     // 1254
	}
	```

4. **Major problem** with `var` is that we don't know whether the variable is declared/used previously or not, which might cause unforseen errors.

### let

1. `let` is block scoped (if/eles blocks, loops, functions, etc), if the same variable is defined in different scopes, there will be no error.
	```js
	function blockCheck() {
		let a = 10; 
		
		if (true) { 
			let a = 20; 
			console.log(a);      // Output: 20 
		} 
		
		console.log(a);          // Output: 10
		
		// It is a bit different with var
		var x = 10;              // Here x is 10  
		
		if (true) {  
			var x = 2;  
			console.log(x);      // Here x is 2  
		}  
		console.log(x);          // Here x is 2		
	}
	```

2. variable declared with `let`, cannot be redeclared, but can be updated. 
	```js
	let x = "John Doe";  
	let x = 0;            // This will throw an Error
	
	// Also redeclaring it with other declarator(i might have made up this word) is not allowed.
	let x = 30;
	var x = 10;
	
	console.log(x);       // This will throw an error
	```

3. Just like  `var`, `let` declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike `var` which is initialized as `undefined`, the `let` keyword is **not initialized**. 
	
	So if you try to use a `let` variable before declaration, you'll get a `Reference Error`.

### const

1. `const`, same as `let`, declarations are block scoped.
2. Variables declared with the `const` maintain constant values throughout the block, therefore it is mandatory to initialize them with a value, else **the declaration will throw an Error**.
3.  Like `let`, `const` declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized. They'll throw and `ReferenceError` when used before declaration.

### Wait, const doesn't mean un-mutable!!

- `const` term doest not mean the assigned values always remain constant. **It means the reference, i.e the memory path/adderess, to the container remains same**
- This means `const` has two meanig depending on the [[03. DataTypes in JS|primitive and referenced data types]]. 
- We should use `const` when we declare:
	-   A new Array
	-   A new Object
	-   A new Function
	-   A new RegExp
	because we can change the elements of the object and not accidently overwrite the whole object by reassigning it!!

	```js
	// Reassigning a constant value
	const myConstant = 10;
	myConstant = 20; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
	
	// Reassigning a constant array
	const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
	myArray = [4, 5, 6]; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
	
	// Changing elements of a constant array
	const myArray2 = [1, 2, 3];
	myArray2[1] = 4;
	console.log(myArray2); // Output: [1, 4, 3]
	
	// Reassigning a constant object
	const myObj = { name: "John", age: 30 };
	myObj = { name: "Jane", age: 25 }; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
	
	// Changing properties of a constant object
	const myObj2 = { name: "John", age: 30 };
	myObj2.age = 35;
	console.log(myObj2); // Output: { name: "John", age: 35 }
	```
